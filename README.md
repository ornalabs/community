## Future fixes


- Scaling Functionality

    - When trying to make model smaller it, moving the to left doesn't quite work as expected view vid => https://watch.screencastify.com/v/3MzmX8FqFtELxx7QvlRU
    
    - _Note_ In order to Resolve the above issue, user can walk closer to the scaling system in order to see proper x y z axis

- Lock Edit menu overlay 
    - The Edit functionality UI overlay moves with camera, therefore taking over more of the screen space which can blocker as the user has to physically move around inorder to get more viewable space.
